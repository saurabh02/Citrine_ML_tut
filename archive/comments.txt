Here are my comments:



3. Put comments/docstring of functions like naiveVectorize inside the function itself, not above them. See PEP guidelines.

4. I am not sure exactly what you are doing to get the average band gap in In[10], but it should be much easier to get the average of a column using Pandas than that.

5. Your use of the apply() function is not clean. That function will pass in all the data, and you have to resort to putting arbitrary and meaningless indices (e.g., x[0], x[1], x[2]) etc throughout your code. That is not the way a clean function is written (i.e., takes in some vector 'x' that has no clear organization). You need to figure out how to apply a function to *single* column of data, and the function that you pass into apply (e.g., extractphysicalFeatures) needs to only take in the data it needs. I think you need to research pandas a bit more.

6. Naming conventions should follow PEP. e.g., methods/functions should be named like this: extract_physical_features.
